## Quick Start

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

After that, you can run the following command to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PromptsLego/party-frontend
```

- install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

If you need to config the mirror, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com/
pnpm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com/

npm config get registry
pnpm config get registry
```

- Run the development server at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

```bash
make start
```

> make start will run `npm run dev` actually, so if you not have make installed, you can run `npm run dev` directly.
